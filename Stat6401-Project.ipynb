    "  3. Run the code provided in the [RBVNsim3.R](https://github.com/esuess/stat6401/blob/master/RBVNsim3.R) handout. Verify that the transformations perform as described.\n",
    "2. Investigate the use of the R packages, *IDPmisc* and *gplots*. In the *IDPmisc* package there is a command *ipairs* that is useful for plotting large amounts of data using color.  In the *gplots* package there is a command *hist2d* that is also useful for large data and uses color.\n",
    "Run the code provided at the bottom of the RBVNsim3.R handout. Use the output to better visualize the  correlation/dependence between the random values that have been simulated in the previous part.\n",
    "3.  If you want to work on a more theoretical project, such as applications of Bivariate Distributions, Transformations or Markov Chairs, then contact the Professor to discuss alternative plans for the Project."
